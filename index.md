    <h3>Java game 2022</h3>
    <p>
	The aim of this project was to create a 2D game using the city physics engine provided to us. The game consists of 3 levels, with different enemies in each level. The aim of the game is to kill all the enemies in each level to proceed to the boss, and collect all the coins along the way. The game has 3 different sound tracks for each level, different sounds for the variety of interactions between the player and the world as well as a menu that allows the player to save, pause, resume and quit.
